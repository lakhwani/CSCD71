# CSCD71 Course Materials

## Introduction
Welcome to the CSCD71 course tutorial materials repository. This repository contains educational resources and tutorial content prepared for the course "CSCD71: Blockchain and Decentralized Applications" at the University of Toronto under Professor Thierry Sans and David Liu. As a Teaching Assistant, I've developed these materials to assist students in understanding key concepts and practical applications in blockchain technology.

## Folder Structure
This repository is organized into tutorial folders. Each folder corresponds to a specific tutorial session and contains relevant materials, including code examples and/or tutorial slides. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each folder:

### Tutorial 1: Introduction to Bitcoin Wallets
- **Description:** This tutorial covers the basics of Bitcoin wallets. It includes setting up wallets, creating accounts, sending transactions, using faucets, and exploring blocks.
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-1/D71_TUT_1.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.

### Tutorial 2: Multisignature Wallets and P2SH
- **Description:** Focuses on advanced Bitcoin wallet features like multi-signature wallets and Pay to Script Hash (P2SH).
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-2/D71_TUT_2.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.
  - `tutorial-2/generateKeys.py`: Script to generate keys to be used for the bitcoin multisignature wallet.
  - `tutorial-2/multisigMain.py`: Script to create a 2/3 multi-signature wallet and perform a transaction with 2/3 signers. 

### Tutorial 3: ERC Standards - ERC-721 and ERC-20
- **Description:** This tutorial delves into ERC-721 and ERC-20 token standards, covering deployment processes and demonstrations.
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-3/D71_TUT_3.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.
  - `tutorial-3/`:  This folder contains Solidity smart contract examples for both ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Tokens) and ERC-20 (Fungible Tokens), along with additional scripts demonstrating their deployment and interaction. The contents are designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how to work with these popular token standards in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Tutorial 4: DeFi - Borrowing and Lending Protocols
- **Description:** Explores the fundamentals of decentralized finance (DeFi), specifically focusing on borrowing and lending protocols.
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-4/D71_TUT_4.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.

### Tutorial 5: DeFi - AMMs and Decentralized Exchanges
- **Description:** This session covers Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Decentralized Exchanges, and their functioning, with a focus on Uniswap.
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-5/D71_TUT_5.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.

### Tutorial 6: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Applications
- **Description:** Discusses the concept of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, their impact, and applications, including a demo on Zk-rollups.
- **Contents:** 
  - `tutorial-6/D71_TUT_6.pdf`: Slides/notes used during the tutorial session.
  - `tutorial-6/`: This directory features a prototype ZK-rollup, including the complete setup from circuit design to the finalized tau ceremony. It also encompasses the creation and verification of proofs, along with the necessary inputs. This comprehensive resource is meant to demonstrate the practical application of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in blockchain scalability solutions.
